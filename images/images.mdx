It's very simple to use: you only need to submit your `api_key` and an image via url or POST to the API, and the API will respond as assessment of its validity, as well as additional details like the carrier details, line type, region and city details, and more.

## Getting started

### REST

The Image Processing API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The Image Processing API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The Image Processing API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's Image Processing API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the Image Processing and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

### Base URL

```
curl https://images.abstractapi.com/v1/url/
```

### Validation endpoint

Abstract's Image Processing API simply requires your unique API key and the phone number you'd like to check:

```
curl https://images.abstractapi.com/v1/url/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& phone = 14154582468

curl https://images.abstractapi.com/v1/url/ 
-X POST 
-H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-H "Accept: application/json" 
-d '{"api_key": YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY, "lossy": true, "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.abstractapi.com/test-images/dog.jpg"}
```

This was a successful request, so the valid phone number and details associated with it are returned below:

<ResponseExample>

```json
{
  "phone": "14152007986",
  "valid": true,
  "format": {
    "international": "+14152007986",
    "local": "(415) 200-7986"
  },
  "country": {
    "code": "US",
    "name": "United States",
    "prefix": "+1"
  },
  "location": "California",
  "type": "mobile",
  "carrier": "T-Mobile USA, Inc."
}
```

</ResponseExample>

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="String" required>
  Your unique API key. Note that each user has unique API keys _for each of
  Abstract's APIs_, so your Phone Validation API key will not work for your IP
  Geolocation API key, for example.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="phone" type="String" required>
  The phone number to validate and verify.
