It's very simple to use: you only need to submit your `api_key` and an image via url or POST to the API, and the API will respond as assessment of its validity, as well as additional details like the carrier details, line type, region and city details, and more.

## Getting started

There are two methods to begin working with an image

<Card title="Upload via URL" icon="link" href="images/url">
  Upload an image giving the API an URL with a hosted version of your image.
</Card>

<Card title="Upload via POST" icon="upload" href="images/upload">
  Upload an image submitting it directly to the API.
</Card>

### REST

The Image Processing API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The Image Processing API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The Image Processing API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's Image Processing API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the Image Processing and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

## Response and error codes

Whenever you make a request that fails for some reason, an error is returned also in the JSON format. The errors include an error code and description, which you can find in detail below.
