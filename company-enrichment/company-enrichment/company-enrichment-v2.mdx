description: "With Abstract's Company Enrichment API, you can get the company details of any domain."
api: 'GET https://companyenrichment.abstractapi.com/v2'
hideApiMarker: true
---

It's very simple to use: you are only required to send your unique `api_key` and the `domain` you want to enrich to get information about the company.

## Getting started

### REST

The Company Enrichment API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The Company Enrichment API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The Company Enrichment API is currently on Version 2.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's Company Enrichment API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the Company Enrichment and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

### Base URL

```
https://companyenrichment.abstractapi.com/v2
```

### Validation endpoint

Abstract's Company Enrichment API simply requires your unique API key and the domain you'd like to enrich:

```
https://companyenrichment.abstractapi.com/v2
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& domain = airbnb.com
```

This was a successful request, so the company details associated with the domain are returned below:

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="String" required>

  Geolocation API, for example.

## Other notes

A note on metered billing: Each individual domain you submit for lookup counts as a credit used. Credits are also counted per request, not per successful response. So if you submit a request for the (invalid) domain "kasj8929hs", that still counts as 1 credit.
