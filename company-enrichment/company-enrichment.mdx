description: "With Abstract's Company Enrichment API, you can get the company details of any domain."
api: 'GET https://companyenrichment.abstractapi.com/v1'
hideApiMarker: true
---

It's very simple to use: you are only required to send your unique `api_key` and the `domain` you want to enrich to get information about the company.

## Getting started

### REST

The Company Enrichment API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The Company Enrichment API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The Company Enrichment API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's Company Enrichment API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the Company Enrichment and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

### Base URL

```
https://companyenrichment.abstractapi.com/v1
```

### Validation endpoint

Abstract's Company Enrichment API simply requires your unique API key and the domain you'd like to enrich:

```
https://companyenrichment.abstractapi.com/v1
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& domain = airbnb.com
```

This was a successful request, so the company details associated with the domain are returned below:

<ResponseExample>

```json
{
    "name": "Airbnb",
    "domain": "airbnb.com",
    "year_founded": 2008,
    "industry": "Internet",
    "employees_count": 14604,
    "locality": "San Francisco",
    "country": "United States",
    "linkedin_url": "linkedin.com/company/airbnb"
}
```

</ResponseExample>

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="String" required>
  Your unique API key. Note that each user has unique API keys _for each of
  Abstract's APIs_, so your Company Enrichment API key will not work for your IP
  Geolocation API, for example.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="domain" type="String" required>
  The domain of the company you want to get data from.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="fields" type="String">
  You can chose to only receive a few fields from the JSON response. To do so, you can include a fields value in the query parameters with a comma separated list of the top-level keys you want to be returned. For example, adding ?fields=city will return only the city in the JSON response.
</ParamField>

### Response parameters

The API response is returned in a universal and lightweight [JSON format](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

<ResponseField name="name" type="String">
  The name of the company.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="domain" type="String">
  The domain the company website is hosted on.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="country" type="String">
  The country the company is based in.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="locality" type="String">
  The city or regiont he company headquarter is based in.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="employees_count" type="String">
  The approximate number of employees of the company.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="industry" type="String">
  The industry the company is operating in.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="year_founded" type="Uint32">
  The year the company was founded.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="linkedin_url" type="String">
  The linkedin URL of the company.
</ResponseField>

## Response and error codes

Whenever you make a request that fails for some reason, an error is returned also in the JSON format. The errors include an error code and description, which you can find in detail below.

## Other notes

A note on metered billing: Each individual domain you submit for lookup counts as a credit used. Credits are also counted per request, not per successful response. So if you submit a request for the (invalid) domain "kasj8929hs", that still counts as 1 credit.
