## Getting started

<Card title="Live exchange rates" icon="wave-pulse" href="live">
  The `live` endpoint returns the most recent exchange rate(s) for a given set of currencies. The base currency is the currency you're converting FROM, while the target currency or currencies are what you're converting TO.
</Card>

<Card title="Convert exchange rates" icon="money-bill-transfer" href="convert">
  The `convert` endpoint is similar to the `live` endpoint, except it allows you to convert an arbitrary amount of currency.
</Card>

<Card title="Historical exchange rates (beta)" icon="landmark" href="historical">
  The `historical` endpoint functions almost exactly like the /live/ endpoint, except it requires you to request a date parameter, and subsequently returns the returns the most recent exchange rate(s) for a given set of currencies.
</Card>

### REST

The Exchange Rates API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The Exchange Rates API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The Exchange Rates API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's Exchange Rates API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the Exchange Rates and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

## Response and error codes

Whenever you make a request that fails for some reason, an error is returned also in the JSON format. The errors include an error code and description, which you can find in detail below.
