## Getting started

<Card title="Current time endpoint" icon="clock" href="current-time">
  The `current_time` endpoint take a location in the form of a location name, latitude and longitude, or IP address and returns the current time, date, and timezone of that location.
</Card>

<Card title="Convert timezones endpoint" icon="clock-rotate-left" href="convert-time">
  The `convert_time` endpoint makes it easy to convert the time and date of a given location to the time and date of another location. By default it converts the current time, but the conversion can take place in either the past or future with a simple parameter.
</Card>

### REST

The Timezones API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The Timezones API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The Timezones API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's Timezones API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the Timezones and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

## Response and error codes

Whenever you make a request that fails for some reason, an error is returned also in the JSON format. The errors include an error code and description, which you can find in detail below.

| Code        | Type                    | Details                                                                                                                                                     |

| 401         | Unauthorized            | The request was unacceptable. Typically due to the API key missing or incorrect.                                                                            |

## Other notes

A note on metered billing: Each individual domain you submit for lookup counts as a credit used. So, if you submit 20 different domain in a single request, that will count as 20 credits against your monthly quota. Credits are also counted per request, not per successful response. So if you submit a request for the (invalid) domain "kasj8929hs", that still counts as 1 credit.
