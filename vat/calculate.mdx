## Getting started

? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& amount = 175  
& country_code = DE
```

This was a successful request, and the details below are included in the response:

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="String" required>
  Your unique API key. Note that each user has unique API keys for each of Abstract's APIs, so your VAT Validation API key will not work for as your IP Geolocation API key, for example.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="amount" type="String" required>
  The amount that you would like to get the VAT amount for or from.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="country_code" type="String" required>
  The two letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the country in which the transaction takes place.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="is_vat_incl" type="Boolean">
  If the amount already has VAT added and you'd like to do the reverse calculation and split out the amount and VAT, set this parameter to true. If this parameter is not explicitly included it will default to false.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="vat_category" type="String">
  Some countries offer a reduced VAT rate for certain categories of goods. To determine if a reduced VAT is available and to apply it to the final amount, include the vat_category in the request.
</ParamField>
