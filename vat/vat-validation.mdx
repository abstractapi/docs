### REST

The VAT Validation API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The VAT Validation API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The VAT Validation API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's VAT Validation API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the VAT Validation and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

## Response and error codes

Whenever you make a request that fails for some reason, an error is returned also in the JSON format. The errors include an error code and description, which you can find in detail below.
