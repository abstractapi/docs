## Getting Started

Abstract's Email Reputation API requires only your unique API key `api_key` and a single email `email`:

```bash
https://emailreputation.abstractapi.com/v1/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& email = johnsmith@gmail.com
```

This was a successful request, and all available details about that email were returned:

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="string" required>

## Request examples

### Checking a malformed email

In the example below, we show the request and response for an email does not follow the proper format. If the email fails the `is_format_valid` check, then the other checks will not be performed and will be returned as false

```bash
https://emailreputation.abstractapi.com/v1/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& email = johnsmith
```

The request was valid and successful, and so it returns the following:

```json
{
  "email_address": "johnsmith",
  "email_deliverability": {
    "status": "undeliverable",
    "status_detail": "invalid_format",
    "is_format_valid": false,
    "is_smtp_valid": false,
    "is_mx_valid": false,
    "mx_records": []
  },
  "email_quality": {
    "score": null,
    "is_free_email": null,
    "is_username_suspicious": null,
    "is_disposable": null,
    "is_catchall": null,
    "is_subaddress": null,
    "is_role": null,
    "is_dmarc_enforced": null,
    "is_spf_strict": null,
    "minimum_age": null
    },
  "email_sender": {
    "first_name": null,
    "last_name": null,
    "email_provider_name": null,

    "date_last_renewed": null,
    "date_expires": null,
    "is_risky_tld": null
  },
  "email_risk": {
    "address_risk_status": null,

  },

    "total_breaches": null,
    "date_first_breached": null,
    "date_last_breached": null,
    "breached_domains": []
  }
}
```

## Possible values for status_detail

This field provides more information about the deliverability result.

#### When `status` is `deliverable`:

- **valid_email**: The email address exists, is valid, and can receive new emails.
- **high_traffic_email**: The email is valid and exists, but the server is receiving too many messages. Your email might bounce.

#### When `status` is `undeliverable`:

- **invalid_mailbox**: The email address doesn't exist or is no longer active. It can't receive new emails.
- **full_mailbox**: The email exists but its mailbox is full, so new emails will bounce.
- **invalid_format**: The email doesn't follow the correct format (e.g., missing `@` or domain).
- **dns_record_not_found**: We couldn't find MX records for the domain, so we couldnâ€™t complete the SMTP check.
- **unavailable_server**: The mail server for the domain is currently unreachable.

#### When `status` is `unknown`:

- **null**

## Bulk upload (CSV)

Don't know how to or don't want to make API calls? Use the bulk CSV uploader to easily use the API. The results will be sent to your email when ready.

Here are some best practices when bulk uploading a CSV file:

* Ensure the selected column contains the email addresses to be analyzed.
* Remove any empty rows from the file.
* Include only one email address per row.
* The maximum file size permitted is 50,000 rows.


## Response and error codes

Whenever you make a request that fails for some reason, an error is returned also in the JSON format. The errors include an error code and description, which you can find in detail below.

| 401         | Unauthorized            | The request was unacceptable. Typically due to the API key missing or incorrect.                                                                            |
| 422         | Quota reached	          | The request was aborted due to insufficient API credits. (Free plans)                                                                                       |
| 429         | Too many requests       | The request was aborted due to the number of allowed requests per second being reached. This happens on free plans as requests are limited to 1 per second. |
| 500         | Internal server error	  | The request could not be completed due to an error on the server side.                                                                                      |

## Other notes

A note on metered billing: Each individual email you submit counts as a credit used. Credits are also counted per request, not per successful response. So if you submit a request for the (invalid) email address "kasj8929hs", that still counts as 1 credit.
