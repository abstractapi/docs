It's very simple to use: you only need to submit your API key and a IP address, and the API will respond with the location of that IP including postal code, city, region, country and lat/long data.

## Getting started

### REST

The IP Geolocation API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The IP Geolocation API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The IP Geolocation API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's IP Geolocation API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the IP Geolocation and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

### Base URL

```
https://ipgeolocation.abstractapi.com/v1/
```

### Validation endpoint

Abstract's IP Geolocation API simply requires your unique API key and will automatically detect the IP address from the client where it is called. You can also append the "ip_address" parameter to specify the IP to analyze:

```
https://ipgeolocation.abstractapi.com/v1/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& ip_address = 181.231.108.147 (optional)
```

This was a successful request, so the IP address and details associated with it are returned below:

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="String" required>
  Your unique API key. Note that each user has unique API keys _for each of
  Abstract's APIs_, so your Phone Validation API key will not work for your IP
  Geolocation API key, for example.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="ip_address" type="String">
  The IP address to geolocate. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported. Note that if you leave this parameter blank, the service will geolocate the IP address from which the request was made.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="fields" type="String">
  You can chose to only receive a few fields from the JSON response. To do so, you can include a fields value in the query parameters with a comma separated list of the top-level keys you want to be returned. For example, adding ?fields=city will return only the city in the JSON response.
</ParamField>

### Limiting response fields

You can choose to only receive a few fields from the JSON response. To do so, you can include a fields value in the query parameters with a comma separated list of the top-level keys you want to be returned.

For example, a request to only get the country and city of an IP will look like this:
```
https://ipgeolocation.abstractapi.com/v1/
    ? api_key = YOUR_API_KEY
    & ip_address = 166.171.248.255
    & fields = country,city
```

The response would look like this:
```json
{
  "country": "United States",
  "city": "Modesto"
}
```

## Use cases

### Geolocating a website visitor

To request the geolocation from an IP address, simply include your unique API key in the template below.

Note that you don't need to know the IP of the visitor to make the request.
```
$.getJSON("https://ipgeolocation.abstractapi.com/v1/?api_key=YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY", function(data) {
       console.log(data.ip_address);
       console.log(data.country);
   })
```

That's all your need to get the geolocation and other data from a visitor! There is only one required parameter: your unique API key.

## Response and error codes

Whenever you make a request that fails for some reason, an error is returned also in the JSON format. The errors include an error code and description, which you can find in detail below.
