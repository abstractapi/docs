description: "Abstract's Public Holidays API is a fast, lightweight, modern, and RESTful JSON API that allows you to get the public, local, religious, and other holidays of a particular country."
api: 'GET https://holidays.abstractapi.com/v1/'
hideApiMarker: true
---

It's simple to use: you only need to submit your `api_key` and a two letter country code `country`. The API will return the public holidays for that country.

## Getting started

### REST

The Public Holidays API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The Public Holidays API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The Public Holidays API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's Public Holidays API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the Public Holidays and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

### Base URL

```
https://holidays.abstractapi.com/v1/
```

### Validation endpoint

Abstract's Public Holidays API simply requires your unique API key and the country you'd like to get the public holidays from.

```
https://holidays.abstractapi.com/v1/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& country = SG
```

This was a successful request, so the public holidays from Singapur and details associated with it are returned below:

### Checking specific days, months, or years

It's also possible to specify the day, month, or year. Note that if you specify a day, you must also include a month and year. If you specify a month, you must also specify the year.

For example, this return all the holidays in the US in January 2021:

```
https://holidays.abstractapi.com/v1/  
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY  
& country = US
& year = 2021
& month = 01
```

And this would return any holidays in the US on January 1, 2021:

```
https://holidays.abstractapi.com/v1/  
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY  
& country = US
& year = 2021
& month = 01
& day = 01
```

> Note: if the query is valid but there are no holidays in the checked period, you will get a 200 response with an empty array.
