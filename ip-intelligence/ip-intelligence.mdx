description: "Abstract's IP Intelligence API is a fast, reliable, and RESTful JSON API that provides advanced security and geographical insights about IP addresses worldwide. It identifies VPNs, proxies, TOR usage, abuse potential, hosting services, relays, and mobile IPs."

It is very simple to use: you only need to submit your API key and an IP address, and the API will respond with the location of that IP and security details, including VPN detection, proxy status, TOR usage, abuse potential, hosting services, relay status, and mobile IP identification.

## Getting started

### REST

The IP Intelligence API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The IP Intelligence API requires all communications to be secured with TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's APIs are versioned. The IP Intelligence API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's IP Intelligence API. Note that each of Abstract's APIs has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the IP Intelligence and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

### Base URL

```
https://ipintelligence.abstractapi.com/v1/
```

### Validation endpoint

Abstract's IP Intelligence API simply requires your unique API key and will automatically detect the IP address from the client where it is called. You can also append the "ip_address" parameter to specify the IP to analyze:

```
https://ipintelligence.abstractapi.com/v1/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& ip_address = 166.171.248.255 (optional)
```

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="String" required>
  Your unique API key. Note that each user has unique API keys for each of Abstract's APIs, so your IP Intelligence API key will not work for your Email Validation API, for example.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="ip_address" type="String">
  The IP address to analyze. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported. Note that if you leave this parameter blank, the service will geolocate the IP address from which the request was made.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="fields" type="String">
  You can chose to only receive a few fields from the JSON response. To do so, you can include a fields value in the query parameters with a comma separated list of the top-level keys you want to be returned. For example, adding ?fields=city will return only the city in the JSON response.
</ParamField>

This was a successful request, so the IP address and details associated with it are returned below:

### Limiting response fields

You can choose to only receive a few fields from the JSON response. To do so, you can include a fields value in the query parameters with a comma separated list of the top-level keys you want to be returned.

For example, a request to only get the country and city of an IP will look like this:
```
https://ipintelligence.abstractapi.com/v1/
    ? api_key = YOUR_API_KEY
    & ip_address = 166.171.248.255
    & fields = country,city
```

The response would look like this:
```json
{
  "country": "United States",
  "city": "Modesto"
}
```

## Response and error codes

Whenever you make a request that fails for some reason, an error is returned also in the JSON format. The errors include an error code and description, which you can find in detail below.

## Other notes

A note on metered billing: Each individual IP you submit counts as a credit used. Credits are also counted per request, not per successful response. So if you submit a request for the (invalid) IP address "kasj8929hs", that still counts as 1 credit.
