It's very simple to use: you only need to submit your API key and a phone number, and the API will respond as assessment of its validity, as well as additional details like the carrier details, line type, region and city details, and more.

Validating and verifying phone numbers is a critical step to reducing the chances of low quality data and fraudulent or risky users in your website or application.

## Getting started

### REST

The Phone Number Validation and Verification API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The Phone Number Validation and Verification API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The Phone Number Validation and Verification API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's Phone Number Validation and Verification API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the Phone Number Validation and Verification and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

### Base URL

```
https://phonevalidation.abstractapi.com/v1/
```

### Validation endpoint

Abstract's Phone Number Validation and Verification API simply requires your unique API key and the phone number you'd like to check:

```
https://phonevalidation.abstractapi.com/v1/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& phone = 14154582468
```

This was a successful request, so the valid phone number and details associated with it are returned below:

<ResponseExample>

```json
{
  "phone": "14152007986",
  "valid": true,
  "format": {
    "international": "+14152007986",
    "local": "(415) 200-7986"
  },
  "country": {

    "name": "United States",
    "prefix": "+1"
  },
  "location": "California",

}
```

</ResponseExample>

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="String" required>

  Abstract's APIs_, so your Phone Validation API key will not work for your IP
  Geolocation API key, for example.
