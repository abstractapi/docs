It's very simple to use: you only need to submit your `api_key` and a single `URL`, and the API will respond as an screenshot of the provided website.

## Getting started

### REST

The Website Screenshot API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The Website Screenshot API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The Website Screenshot API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's Website Screenshot API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the Website Screenshot and Email Validation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

### Base URL

```
https://screenshot.abstractapi.com/v1/
```

### Validation endpoint

Abstract's Website Screenshot API only has two required parameters for the request, your unique API key and a single URL:

```
https://screenshot.abstractapi.com/v1/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& url = https://news.ycombinator.com
```

This was a successful request, so the screenshot from that URL is returned below:

<img alt="YCombinator news page screenshot" src="/assets/screenshot.png"></img>

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="String" required>
