## Getting Started

Abstract's Email Validation and Verification API requires only your unique API key `api_key` and a single email `email`:

```bash
https://emailvalidation.abstractapi.com/v1/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& email = johnsmith@gmail.com
```

This was a successful request, and all available details about that email were returned:

<ResponseExample>

```json
{
  "email": "johnsmith@gmail.com",
  "autocorrect": "",
  "deliverability": "DELIVERABLE",
  "quality_score": 0.9,
  "is_valid_format": {
    "value": true,
    "text": "TRUE"
  },
  "is_free_email": {
    "value": true,
    "text": "TRUE"
  },
  "is_disposable_email": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_role_email": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_catchall_email": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_mx_found": {
    "value": true,
    "text": "TRUE"
  },
  "is_smtp_valid": {
    "value": true,
    "text": "TRUE"
  },
  "quality_score": 0.9
}
```

</ResponseExample>

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="string" required>
  Your unique API key. Note that each user has unique API keys _for each of
  Abstract's APIs_, so your Email Validation API key will not work for your IP
  Geolocation API, for example.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="email" type="String" required>
  The email address to validate.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="auto_correct" type="Boolean">
  You can chose to disable auto correct. To do so, just input false for the auto_correct param. By default, auto_correct is turned on.
</ParamField>

### Response parameters

The API response is returned in a universal and lightweight [JSON format](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

<ResponseField name="email" type="String">
  The value for "email" that was entered into the request.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="auto_correct" type="String">
  If a typo has been detected then this parameter returns a suggestion of the
  correct email (e.g., johnsmith@gmial.com => johnsmith@gmail.com). If no typo
  is detected then this is empty.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="deliverability" type="String">
  Abstract's evaluation of the deliverability of the email. Possible values are:
  `DELIVERABLE`, `UNDELIVERABLE`, and `UNKNOWN`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="quality_score" type="Float">
  An internal decimal score between 0.01 and 0.99 reflecting Abstract's
  confidence in the quality and deliverability of the submitted email.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="is_valid_format" type="Boolean">
  Is `true` if the email follows the format of "address @ domain . TLD". If any
  of those elements are missing or if they contain extra or incorrect special
  characters, then it returns `false`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="is_free_email" type="Boolean">
  Is `true` if the email's domain is found among Abstract's list of free email
  providers Gmail, Yahoo, etc).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="is_disposable_email" type="Boolean">
  Is `true` if the email's domain is found among Abstract's list of disposable
  email providers (e.g., Mailinator, Yopmail, etc).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="is_role_email" type="Boolean">
  Is `true` if the email's local part (e.g., the "to" part) appears to be for a
  role rather than individual. Examples of this include "team@", "sales@",
  info@", etc.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="is_catchall_email" type="Boolean">
  Is `true` if the domain is configured to [catch all
  email](https://www.corporatecomm.com/faqs/other-questions/what-is-a-catch-all-account).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="is_mx_found" type="Boolean">
  Is `true` if [MX Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record) for the
  domain can be found. **Only available on paid plans. Will return `null` and
  `UNKNOWN` on free plans**.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="is_smtp_valid" type="Boolean">
  Is `true` if the [SMTP
  check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) of the
  email was successful. If the check fails, but other checks are valid, we'll
  return the email as `UNKNOWN`. We recommend not blocking signups or form
  submissions when an SMTP check fails.
</ResponseField>

## Request examples

### Checking a misspelled email

In the example below, we show the request and response when the API detects a possible misspelling in the requested email.

Note that even if a possible misspelling is detected, all of the other checks on that email (e.g., free email, disposable domain, etc) will still be done against the original submitted email, not against the autocorrected email.

```bash
https://emailvalidation.abstractapi.com/v1/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& email = johnsmith@gmial.con
```

The request was valid and successful, and so it returns the following:

```json
{
  "email": "johnsmith@glmai.com",
  "autocorrect": "johnsmith@gmail.com",
  "deliverability": "UNDELIVERABLE",
  "quality_score": 0.0,
  "is_valid_format": {
    "value": true,
    "text": "TRUE"
  },
  "is_free_email": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_disposable_email": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_role_email": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_catchall_email": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_mx_found": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_smtp_valid": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  }
}
```

### Checking a malformed email

In the example below, we show the request and response for an email does not follow the proper format. If the email fails the `is_valid_format` check, then the other checks (e.g., `is_free_email`, `is_role_email`) will not be performed and will be returned as false

```bash
https://emailvalidation.abstractapi.com/v1/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& email = johnsmith
```

The request was valid and successful, and so it returns the following:

```json
{
  "email": "johnsmith",
  "autocorrect": "",
  "deliverability": "UNDELIVERABLE",
  "quality_score": 0.0,
  "is_valid_format": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_free_email": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_disposable_email": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_role_email": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_catchall_email": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_mx_found": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  },
  "is_smtp_valid": {
    "value": false,
    "text": "FALSE"
  }
}
```

## Response and error codes

Whenever you make a request that fails for some reason, an error is returned also in the JSON format. The errors include an error code and description, which you can find in detail below.

| Code        | Type                    | Details                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200         | OK                      | Everything worked as expected.                                                                                                                              |
| 204         | OK                      | Their is no location data for the submitted IP.                                                                                                             |
| 400         | Bad request	            | Bad request.                                                                                                                                                |
| 401         | Unauthorized            | The request was unacceptable. Typically due to the API key missing or incorrect.                                                                            |
| 422         | Quota reached	          | The request was aborted due to insufficient API credits.                                                                                                    |
| 429         | Too many requests       | The request was aborted due to the number of allowed requests per second being reached. This happens on free plans as requests are limited to 1 per second. |
| 500         | Internal server error	  | The request could not be completed due to an error on the server side.                                                                                      |
| 503         | Service unavailable	    | The server was unavailable.                                                                                                                                 |

## Other notes

A note on metered billing: Each individual IP you submit counts as a credit used. So, if you submit 20 different IP addresses in a single request, that will count as 20 credits against your monthly quota. Credits are also counted per request, not per successful response. So if you submit a request for the (invalid) IP address "kasj8929hs", that still counts as 1 credit.
