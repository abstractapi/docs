It's very simple to use: you only need to submit your API key and a phone number, and the API will respond with enriched intelligence data including carrier details, line type, location, messaging gateways, registration info, risk scoring, and breach history.

## Getting started

### REST

The Phone Intelligence API, like all of Abstract's APIs, is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The Phone Intelligence API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The Phone Intelligence API is currently on Version 1.

### Your API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's Phone Intelligence API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the Phone Intelligence and Email Reputation APIs, for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

### Base URL

```
https://phoneintelligence.abstractapi.com/v1/
```

### Validation endpoint

Abstract's Phone Intelligence API simply requires your unique API key and the phone number you'd like to check:

```
https://phoneintelligence.abstractapi.com/v1/
? api_key = YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY
& phone = 14154582468
```

This was a successful request, so the valid phone number and details associated with it are returned below:

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="String" required>
  Your unique API key. Note that each user has unique API keys _for each of
  Abstract's APIs_, so your Phone Validation API key will not work for your IP
  Geolocation API, for example.

  The phone number to validate and verify.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="country" type="String">

## Bulk upload (CSV)

Here are some best practices when bulk uploading a CSV file:

* Ensure the first column contains the phone numbers to be analyzed.
* Remove any empty rows from the file.
* Include only one phone number per row.
* The maximum file size permitted is 50,000 rows.

## Response and error codes

Whenever you make a request that fails for some reason, an error is returned also in the JSON format. The errors include an error code and description, which you can find in detail below.

| 401         | Unauthorized            | The request was unacceptable. Typically due to the API key missing or incorrect.                                                                            |

## Other notes

A note on metered billing: Each individual phone number you submit counts as a credit used. Credits are also counted per request, not per successful response. So if you submit a request for the (invalid) phone number "kasj8929hs", that still counts as 1 credit.
